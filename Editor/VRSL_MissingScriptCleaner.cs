    /// Some shipped prefabs serialise script references that bind to types
    /// outside this package's compile set. In a project that only has the
    /// URP package installed, those references can't bind and every prefab
    /// instance in every scene logs missing-script warnings. The unbound
    /// components are non-functional in that environment anyway, but the
    /// warnings clutter the console and fail Play Mode entry checks.
    ///
    /// This utility walks each scene as it loads and silently removes the
    /// missing-script slots from any GameObject in a VRSL subtree. Once a
    /// VRSL-namespaced component is found anywhere in the tree, the entire
    /// descendant subtree is treated as VRSL territory and its missing-script
    /// slots are scrubbed.
    ///
    /// It does NOT modify the prefab or scene assets on disk: scenes aren't
    /// marked dirty, so no save prompts appear. Cleanup runs again on every
    /// scene open.
