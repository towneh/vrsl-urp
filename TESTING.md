# Testing VRSL URP

How changes to this package get verified. Pick the rows a change plausibly touches, run
those, and report results against them by name — "tested" without naming rows isn't a
verification claim.

Most of this needs eyes on a running scene. Two things don't and should run first, because
they're fast and they catch the failures that are hardest to read from the outside.

## Before anything else

### 1. Shader validation

`VRSL → URP → Validate Shaders`, or headless:

```
Unity.exe -batchmode -quit -projectPath <project> \
  -executeMethod VRSL.URP.EditorScripts.VRSL_ShaderValidation.ValidateFromCommandLine \
  -logFile -
```

Exits non-zero on any error. Run it after touching any `.shader`, `.hlsl` or `.compute`.

**Why it matters:** a fullscreen pass that fails to compile draws *nothing* rather than
drawing wrong, so a shader error presents as "VRSL lighting stopped working" with no visible
cause. The Console entry is easy to lose in a project's normal noise.

**What it doesn't cover:** editor shader compilation is lazy — Unity compiles the variants the
importer asks for, not the full keyword matrix. Errors confined to a variant only a specific
scene requests can still get through. It reliably catches base-variant failures, which
includes anything structural.

### 2. Diagnostics

Right-click either light manager in play mode → **VRSL Diagnostics**. Reports shader compile
state, decoded light data, tile-cull statistics, prepass configuration and camera mode.

**Play mode only.** Neither manager has `[ExecuteAlways]`, so nothing initialises in the
editor — the report says so rather than presenting empty figures as findings.

Run this first whenever something is dark. It separates causes that look identical on screen:

| Report line | Means |
|---|---|
| `FAILED TO COMPILE` | Shader problem. Nothing downstream matters until it's fixed. |
| `Light data: 0/N emitting` | Data problem — the decode produced nothing. Rendering is irrelevant. |
| `Tile culling: INACTIVE` | Falling back to iterating every fixture. Correct, but unbounded in cost. |
| `hit the 64-light cap` | Fixtures are being silently dropped in dense tiles. |
| `Surface prepass: normals only` | Everything lights as neutral grey; albedo isn't reaching the BRDF. |
| `NOT IN PLAY MODE` | Nothing is initialised. Enter play mode; shader assignment is still reported. |
| `Fixtures: NONE FOUND` | The manager collected nothing on enable — wrong manager for the scene, or fixtures inactive/added since. |

## Test matrix

Rows are independent. `D` = DMX path, `A` = AudioLink path, `—` = either.

### Core light path

| # | Path | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | D | Open a DMX example scene, run a cue | Fixtures track dimmer, colour and strobe; `Log Decoded Fixture Light Data` shows non-zero intensity on lit fixtures |
| C2 | D | Patch a fixture at a channel whose offset lands mid-row (base ≡ 1 mod 13, read +5 dimmer) | Dimmer responds to the correct channel, not a neighbour's. **Guards the decode row truncation** |
| C3 | D | Moving head, pan and tilt channels | Beam aims correctly; fine channels smooth the motion |
| C4 | A | AudioLink scene with audio playing | Fixtures react to their band; `bandMultiplier` changes sensitivity, not peak |
| C5 | — | Fixture faded to black with dimmer up | Light fully extinguishes, no residual glow |

### Surface accuracy

| # | Path | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | — | Spot onto a strongly-coloured textured surface (URP Lit) | Surface keeps its hue; it does **not** wash towards white |
| S2 | — | Spot onto an avatar (Poiyomi / lilToon URP) | Lit, and keeps its texture colour. Black or double-darkened means the override-shader property resolution needs instrumenting |
| S3 | — | Spot across a glossy floor, camera moving | Specular highlight tracks the viewer |
| S4 | — | Metallic vs dielectric material side by side | Metal tints its specular and loses diffuse |
| S5 | — | Geometry drawn by a shader with no forward LightMode tag | Lights as neutral mid-grey rather than black |
| S6 | — | Unassign `surfacePropertiesShader` | Everything falls back to neutral grey, nothing goes black |
| S7 | — | Match `maxIntensity` against a URP spot light of the same Intensity | Comparable brightness at full output |

### Occlusion

| # | Path | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| O1 | — | `contactShadowStrength` 0 → 1, avatar standing in a beam | Shadow appears at its feet |
| O2 | — | Walk the occluder towards the edge of frame | Shadow fades out as it leaves screen. **Expected** — screen-space only |
| O3 | — | Wall between fixture and a surface across the room | Still lit through the wall. **Expected** — no light-perspective shadows |
| O4 | — | Raise `contactShadowSteps` on thin geometry | Less light leaking through |

### Cost and culling

| # | Path | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | — | Clear `lightCullShader`, compare | Identical image, worse frametime. Any visual change means the cull is wrong |
| P2 | — | Diagnostics with fixtures spread across the venue | Average lights/tile well below fixture count |
| P3 | — | Profiling sample sweep, 10 → 25 → 50 → 100 → 200 | Frametime scales sub-linearly with fixture count |
| P4 | — | `InsideCones` vs `OutsideCones` camera variants | Inside is the worst case; the gap shows culling working |

### Volumetrics

| # | Path | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | — | `Half` (default) | Cones visible, silhouetted correctly against geometry |
| V2 | — | `Full` | Same shape, no upsample fringing, ~4× the per-pixel cost |
| V3 | — | `Froxel` | Beams in the same **place** as Half, but visibly softer — that is the mode's nature, not a fault. Beams vanishing, mirrored, or misplaced points at the depth-slice mapping, the clip-Y flip or the per-eye packing |
| V4 | — | `Froxel` with `froxelMaxDistance` below the room depth | Scattering stops at that distance. **Expected** |
| V5 | — | Toggle `volumetricUseNoise` | Density becomes patchy; no cost when off |
| V6 | — | Select `Froxel` with `froxelShader` unassigned | Falls back to the raymarch, cones still render, one Console warning. Silent loss of all volumetrics is the failure this guards |
| V7 | — | From V6, assign `froxelShader`, then disable and re-enable the manager | Froxel mode now renders. Guards the passes going stale across enable cycles, which made the warning's own advice a no-op |
| V9 | — | Toggle `coupleToSceneFog` in **Froxel** mode with scene fog on | Shaft brightness and tint respond. Guards the toggle silently doing nothing outside the raymarch |
| V8 | — | Set `froxelResolution` to something out of range (e.g. 0 or 2000 on an axis) | Diagnostics report the clamped value and flag it as CLAMPED, not the value typed |

### Cameras

| # | Path | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | D | Scene with a DMX screen reader | `Log Decoded Fixture Light Data` unaffected by fixture proximity to the reader quad. **Guards additive light corrupting the decode chain** |
| M2 | — | Mirror pointed at the rig, `secondaryCameraMode = Full` | Beams and lighting appear in the mirror |
| M3 | — | `SurfaceOnly` | Surface lighting in the mirror, no volumetric cones |
| M4 | — | `Skip` | No VRSL lighting in the mirror |

### VR (single-pass instanced)

| # | Path | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| X1 | — | Any lit scene in headset | Lighting identical in both eyes |
| X2 | — | Volumetric cones in headset | Cones in the same world position in both eyes |
| X3 | — | Diagnostics, tile culling active | No vertical mirroring of lighting between eyes. Mirroring points at the `renderIntoTexture` inference in `VRSLTileCullPass`; clearing `lightCullShader` isolates it |
| X4 | — | Fixture body meshes in headset | Visible in both eyes |

## Known gaps — not bugs

Don't raise these; they're documented limitations with reasons in
`Documentation~/URP-Realtime-Volumetric-Lights.md`.

- Light doesn't stop at walls — only contact shadows exist, no light-perspective shadow maps.
- Occluders off screen cast no shadow, and shadows fade as an occluder leaves frame.
- Smoothness and metallic **maps** aren't sampled; only the scalar material properties are.
  A material with a metallic map reads at its smoothness *ceiling*, so it will look glossier
  than it renders.
- No ambient occlusion term. AO models indirect occlusion and would be wrong applied to
  direct light.
- Transparent geometry receives no VRSL light — the passes run after opaques.
- Running the DMX and AudioLink managers on the same camera is unsupported; both write
  `_VRSLLights` and the last one scheduled wins.
- Froxel mode represents no scattering past `froxelMaxDistance`.

## Reporting

State the row IDs exercised and their outcome, plus platform and whether it was desktop or
headset. Rows not run should be named as such rather than left implied.

When a change alters the feature surface — a new capability, a removed one, a changed
expectation — update this file in the same branch.
