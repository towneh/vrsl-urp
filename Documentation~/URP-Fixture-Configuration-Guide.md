# VRSL URP Fixture Configuration Guide

Setup and authoring for VRSL realtime lights on Unity 6 URP. For pipeline architecture, struct layouts, and tuning internals, see `URP-Realtime-Volumetric-Lights.md`.

This guide covers two paths:

- **DMX** — fixtures driven by an Artnet/OSC signal through the existing CRT chain.
- **AudioLink** — fixtures driven by AudioLink's audio analysis texture, no DMX needed.

The two paths share most authoring concepts; differences are called out per section.

## Quickstart

The two URP-only shaders (`Hidden/VRSL-URP/DeferredLighting`, `Hidden/VRSL-URP/VolumetricLighting`) ship at `Runtime/Shaders/Surface/` inside this package. URP is a hard dependency, so the shaders compile unconditionally and the Light Manager menu utilities can resolve them via `Shader.Find` without any sample-import step.

VRSL never reads, mutates, or recommends URP asset / URP renderer asset settings — those belong to your project. The realtime light path is implemented entirely through runtime pass injection and a VRSL-owned normals prepass, so it co-exists with whatever URP renderer configuration the project uses.

Two menu utilities under `VRSL → URP` cover scene-level setup. Both are idempotent — safe to re-run.

| Menu | Effect |
|---|---|
| **VRSL → URP → Add Light Manager to Active Scene** | Creates a `VRSL URP Light Manager` GameObject in the active scene with compute / lighting / volumetric shader references assigned. |
| **VRSL → URP → Setup AudioLink Realtime Lights in Scene** | Adds `VRStageLighting_AudioLink_RealtimeLight` to every AudioLink mover spotlight in the active scene and wires up pan/tilt transforms. |

The managers inject their render passes at runtime via `RenderPipelineManager.beginCameraRendering`, so there is no `ScriptableRendererFeature` to add to the URP Renderer asset. This is what lets the package work in environments where users don't author the renderer asset (notably VRChat worlds, where the renderer is owned by the VRChat client).

`VRSLNormalsPrepass` (enqueued automatically by the manager) writes `_VRSLNormalsTexture` from the same `DepthNormals` / `DepthNormalsOnly` shader tags URP's built-in depth-normals prepass uses — any opaque shader with a URP `DepthNormals` pass (URP Lit / Poiyomi URP / lilToon URP / Mochie URP) contributes its authored normals automatically; third-party shader authors don't need to add anything VRSL-specific. Surfaces drawn by shaders without a URP `DepthNormals` pass fall back to depth-derivative normals on the lit pixels.

The remainder of this document describes the per-fixture fields exposed in the inspectors.

## Manager Setup

### DMX — `VRSL_URPLightManager`

| Field | Asset |
|---|---|
| `dmxMainTexture` | CRT producing `_VRSLU_DMXGridRenderTexture` |
| `dmxMovementTexture` | CRT producing `_VRSLU_DMXGridRenderTextureMovement` |
| `dmxStrobeTexture` | CRT producing `_VRSLU_DMXGridStrobeOutput` |
| `dmxSpinTimerTexture` | CRT producing `_VRSLU_DMXGridSpinTimer` |
| `computeShader` | `VRSLDMXLightUpdate` |
| `lightingShader` | `Hidden/VRSL-URP/DeferredLighting` |
| `volumetricShader` | `Hidden/VRSL-URP/VolumetricLighting` |
| `goboTextures` | Optional `Texture2D[]` packed into a shared `Texture2DArray`; DMX channel +11 selects the slot. |

### AudioLink — `VRSL_AudioLinkURPLightManager`

| Field | Asset |
|---|---|
| `computeShader` | `VRSLAudioLinkLightUpdate` |
| `lightingShader` | `Hidden/VRSL-URP/DeferredLighting` |
| `volumetricShader` | `Hidden/VRSL-URP/VolumetricLighting` |
| `goboTextures` | Optional `Texture2D[]` for the shared gobo wheel. |
| `samplingTexture` | Optional `Texture2D` or `RenderTexture` sampled by every fixture in `ColorTexture` / `ColorTextureTraditional` color modes. Per-fixture `textureSamplingCoordinates` UVs pick the colour. Leave empty when no fixtures use those modes. |

The AudioLink manager auto-discovers `_AudioTexture` from the global shader property; no texture references are needed.

### Volumetric tuning (both managers)

The volumetric pass runs whenever `volumetricShader` is assigned. Inspector fields:

| Field | Effect |
|---|---|
| `volumetricStepCount` | Integration steps per ray (default 32). Cost scales linearly with steps × active fixture count. |
| `volumetricDensity` | Base scattering density. |
| `volumetricAnisotropy` | Henyey–Greenstein g (default 0.2; 0 = isotropic; positive forward-scatters). |
| `volumetricTint` / `volumetricIntensity` | Colour tint and global multiplier. |
| `volumetricUseNoise` + scale / scroll / strength | Modulated 3D-noise density. Off compiles the noise out (zero cost). |
| `coupleToSceneFog` | Multiply density by `unity_FogParams.x` and tint by `unity_FogColor` so a URP VolumeProfile drives shaft brightness globally. |
| `volumetricResolution` | `Half` (default; live VR) or `Full` (cinematic capture; ~4× per-pixel cost). |

To disable the volumetric cones at runtime without touching the shader assignment, drop `volumetricIntensity` to 0.

## Fixture Authoring — Shared Fields

These fields appear on both `VRStageLighting_DMX_RealtimeLight` and `VRStageLighting_AudioLink_RealtimeLight`:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `fixtureType` | `MoverSpotlight`, `MoverWashlight`, `StaticBlinder`, `StaticParLight`, `Custom`. Drives inspector field visibility and sets the wash-vs-spot inner-cone ratio (wash 0.65 = flat-bright with long feather; spot/static 0.5 = falloff over the outer half). |
| `maxIntensity` | Peak lux at full output. Tune relative to scene scale. |
| `range` | Attenuation range in metres. |
| `spotAngle` (AudioLink) / `minSpotAngle` & `maxSpotAngle` (DMX) | Outer cone angle in degrees. DMX channel +4 lerps between min and max. |
| `isPointLight` | Emit as a point light instead of a spot. |
| `emitterDepth` | (m) Pushes the cone apex back along the light direction so the cone arrives at the lens with finite radius `emitterDepth × tan(halfAngle)`. Default 0 reproduces a point source. As a starting point: an LED-bar fixture with a 30° outer half-angle reads well at `emitterDepth ≈ 0.3–0.5 m`. |
| `lensTransform` | Optional child `Transform`. When assigned, the cone's apex projects from the lens position instead of the prefab root — useful on hung mover prefabs where the prefab root sits at the truss-clamp. URP DMX and AudioLink mover prefabs ship with a baked `LensTransform` child; leave empty for fixtures whose root already sits at the lens. |
| `fixtureShellRenderers` | Optional `MeshRenderer[]` on the fixture body. The Realtime light pushes a `MaterialPropertyBlock` so each renderer's lit-lens emissive picks up the same DMX or AudioLink data. |
| `goboIndex` | Selects a slot in the manager's shared gobo wheel. AudioLink uses 1-based indexing (1 = open beam, 2–8 = shaped gobos). |
| `goboSpinSpeed` | Bipolar rotation speed for the projected gobo (negative = CCW, positive = CW). |

### Pan/tilt (movers only)

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `enablePanTilt` | Enable for moving-head fixtures. |
| `panTransform` | Transform rotated on Y for pan. Its world position becomes the light origin. |
| `tiltTransform` | Transform rotated on X for tilt. Its world forward becomes the light direction. |
| `maxMinPan` / `maxMinTilt` | Total travel in degrees (±half from centre). |
| `panOffset` / `tiltOffset` | Per-fixture aim offset. |
| `invertPan` / `invertTilt` | Reverse direction. |

DMX movers get pan/tilt from the DMX channels and apply Rodrigues rotation on the GPU; the `panTransform` / `tiltTransform` references are unused on the DMX path. AudioLink movers read pan/tilt from the animated transforms each frame, so you must wire your animator to those transforms.

## DMX-Specific Authoring

`VRStageLighting_DMX_RealtimeLight`:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `enableDMXChannels` | Enable DMX control. |
| `dmxChannel` / `dmxUniverse` | Industry-standard channel and Artnet universe (1-based). |
| `useLegacySectorMode` / `sector` | Legacy sector addressing for older patches. Sector 0 = channels 1–13, sector 1 = 14–26, etc. |
| `enableFineChannels` | 16-bit pan/tilt via the +1 / +3 channels. |
| `enableStrobe` | Allow the DMX strobe channel to gate the light on/off. |
| `enableConeWidth` | Allow ch+4 (motor speed / zoom) to modulate the cone between `minSpotAngle` and `maxSpotAngle`. Disable on par cans and blinders so unrelated traffic on ch+4 doesn't flicker their cone width. |
| `enableGobo` | Allow ch+11 to select gobos. |
| `enableGoboSpin` | Allow ch+10 to drive gobo spin speed. |
| `finalIntensity` / `globalIntensity` | User-side intensity caps (0–1). |

The full per-fixture channel layout (offsets relative to `dmxChannel`):

| Offset | Channel |
|---|---|
| +0 | Pan coarse |
| +1 | Pan fine |
| +2 | Tilt coarse |
| +3 | Tilt fine |
| +4 | Motor speed / cone width |
| +5 | Dimmer / intensity |
| +6 | Strobe gate |
| +7 / +8 / +9 | Red / Green / Blue |
| +10 | Gobo spin speed |
| +11 | Gobo selection |

---

## AudioLink-Specific Authoring

`VRStageLighting_AudioLink_RealtimeLight`:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `enableAudioLink` | When enabled, intensity is driven by AudioLink amplitude. When disabled, the light runs at full `maxIntensity × finalIntensity` regardless — useful for static fixtures in the same scene. |
| `band` | `Bass` / `LowMids` / `HighMids` / `Treble`. |
| `delay` | History delay (0 = most recent, 127 = most delayed). Useful for chasing effects across a row of fixtures. |
| `bandMultiplier` | Sensitivity multiplier — increase if amplitude reads too low for your audio levels. |
| `colorMode` | `Emission` (fixed `emissionColor`), `ThemeColor0–3`, `ColorChord`, `ColorTexture` (modern, HSV-normalised), `ColorTextureTraditional` (raw sample). |
| `emissionColor` | Active when `colorMode == Emission`. Author in HDR for bright fixtures. |
| `textureSamplingCoordinates` | Active in `ColorTexture` modes — UV into `_AudioTexture` to read the colour from. |
| `targetToFollow` | Optional aim target. When set, the fixture's tilt transform tracks this object. |
| `finalIntensity` / `globalIntensity` | User-side intensity caps. |

### Tuning maxIntensity

AudioLink amplitude is normalised (0–1), so `maxIntensity` directly controls peak lux output. Calibration:

1. Play a loud section so the target band is near full amplitude.
2. Adjust `maxIntensity` until illumination on a lit surface matches your artistic intent.
3. Use `bandMultiplier` to control sensitivity (how quickly the light reaches `maxIntensity` from quiet audio) independently of peak brightness.

## Sibling-Static Inheritance

For projects that retain the legacy `VRStageLighting_DMX_Static` / `VRStageLighting_AudioLink_Static` components on the same GameObject (typically VRChat scenes targeting both the volumetric mesh shaders and the URP path), the Realtime light components automatically inherit configuration from a sibling Static, so authors edit one component and both pipelines stay in sync.

| Realtime field | Sibling source (DMX) | Sibling source (AudioLink) |
|---|---|---|
| Addressing | sector / channel / universe / fine-channel mode | — |
| Pan/tilt modifiers | invertPan, invertTilt, maxMinPan, maxMinTilt, panOffset, tiltOffset | — |
| AudioLink reaction | — | enableAudioLink, band, delay, bandMultiplier |
| Final intensity | — | finalIntensity |
| Emission | — | emissionColor (`LightColorTint` on Static) |
| Gobo | — | goboIndex (`SelectGOBO`), goboSpinSpeed (`SpinSpeed`) |

Inherited fields render as read-only "(inherited)" widgets in the Realtime light inspector so the effective values stay visible at a glance.

The supplied URP prefab variants ship without a Static sibling — the Realtime light is the sole authoring surface and drives the fixture body emissive directly via `fixtureShellRenderers`. Sibling-Static inheritance only applies when one is explicitly added.

## Runtime API

```csharp
// DMX: after changing a fixture's config field
VRSL_URPLightManager.Instance.MarkConfigDirty();

// DMX or AudioLink: after adding or removing fixtures at runtime
VRSL_URPLightManager.Instance.RefreshFixtures();
VRSL_AudioLinkURPLightManager.Instance.RefreshFixtures();
```

AudioLink's per-frame fields (`band`, `delay`, `bandMultiplier`, `colorMode`, `emissionColor`, `maxIntensity`, `finalIntensity`, `enableAudioLink`, `goboIndex`, `goboSpinSpeed`) are read every `LateUpdate` and don't require a refresh call.

---

## Prefabs

URP prefab variants ship under `Runtime/Prefabs/`:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Runtime/Prefabs/AudioLink/AudioLink-URP-Fixtures/` | AudioLink mover spotlight, mover washlight, static blinder, static parlight, plus the manager prefab |
| `Runtime/Prefabs/DMX/Horizontal Mode/DMX-13CH-URP-Fixtures/` | DMX 13-channel fixtures + manager (horizontal patch layout) |
| `Runtime/Prefabs/DMX/Vertical Mode/DMX-13CH-URP-Fixtures/` | Same fixtures, vertical patch layout |
| `Runtime/Prefabs/DMX/Legacy Mode/DMX-13CH-URP-Fixtures/` | Manager prefab for legacy sector-mode patches |
| `Runtime/Prefabs/DMX/*/5-Channel Statics/DMX-5CH-URP-Fixtures/` | DMX 5-channel static fixtures (par, blinder) |

URP prefabs are standalone — they ship without the legacy `*_Static` sibling component and without the volumetric mesh GameObject. The Realtime light component is the sole authoring surface, and the volumetric pass renders the cone.

## Example Scenes

| Scene | Path |
|---|---|
| `VRSL-ExampleScene-AudioLink-URPRealtimeLights` | `Runtime/Example Scenes/AudioLink-Scenes/` |

| `VRSL-ExampleScene-EditorViaOSC-Vertical-URPRealtimeLights` | `Runtime/Example Scenes/DMX-EditorViaOSCScenes/` |

Each ships with the manager pre-populated.
